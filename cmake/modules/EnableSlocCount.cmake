# - Creates a target to calculate the source lines of code
#
# If the sloccount executable is found, a special target will be created
# that counts the source lines of code for specified folders. To create this
# target, use this function that can also be used if sloccount was not found:
#
# ENABLE_SLOCCOUNT(FOLDERS Folder ... [RESULT_FILE file])
#
# Results will be given on the console and stored in a file. The default for
# this file is CMAKE_BINARY_DIR/sloccount.sc.
